My girlfriend just wanted a dead-simple way to grab all her favorite YouTube playlists as music files (for her ancient MP3 player).

A GUI YouTube playlist downloader that:

Lets you paste a YouTube channel link, see all playlists, and pick what you want.

Downloads everything as .m4a files (better than mp3 for YouTube audio).

Uses AI (Ollama Llama3 locally) to auto-tag artist/title/album info and remove YouTube junk.

Renames and cleans up files â€” just one tidy .m4a file per song, with correct name and metadata.
